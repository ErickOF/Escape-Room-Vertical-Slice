# Escape Room Vertical Slice

## Design, Develop, and Deploy for VR Course
from Unity Technologies

### Summary
In this comprehensive course from Oculus and Unity, you’ll learn how to build an immersive VR game step by step. Designed for people who have an intermediate knowledge of Unity, the goal of this course is to teach you how to design, develop, and deploy a VR application. You’ll learn an extensive range of principles and best practices: from locomotion and hand presence, to optimization and testing, to user interaction and go-to-market strategy.

Coached along the way by experts from Oculus and Unity, you'll build a vertical slice of an escape room game throughout the course. While the course is geared towards developing for the Oculus Rift, the principles covered also apply to the Oculus Quest, and you’ll learn to avoid some common pitfalls we see developers experience when submitting their application to the Oculus Store. Take your VR skills to the next level with this deep dive into the principles of VR development.
